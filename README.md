# Java Sign Up & Sign In System (Console Project)

This is a beginner-level Java console application built to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and basic program flow.

The project simulates a simple **Sign Up and Sign In system**, similar to how real applications manage user accounts, but in a simplified form for learning purposes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Create a new user account (Sign Up)
- Sign in using email and password
- Prevent duplicate email registrations
- Menu-driven console interface
- Input validation and basic error handling
- Uses arrays to store user data
- Demonstrates encapsulation and method-based design

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Used

- Java Classes & Objects
- Encapsulation (private data + public methods)
- Arrays
- Loops and conditional statements
- Scanner for user input
- Boolean-based logic for validations
- Method responsibility separation

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. User chooses an option from the menu:
   - Create Account
   - Sign In
   - Show Stored Users
   - Exit
2. During signup:
   - Email duplication is checked
   - Password and confirm password must match
3. During login:
   - Email and password are verified against stored data
4. The program runs in a loop until the user exits

## ⚠️ Important Note

This project is created **for learning purposes only**.

- Passwords are stored in plain text (not secure)
- No database is used (data is stored in memory)
- Not intended for production use

Security improvements like password hashing can be added later as a next step.

## 📚 Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand:
- How real-world logic (signup/login) is implemented
- How to design methods with clear responsibilities
- How to handle common beginner issues like input handling
- How to think beyond syntax and focus on program flow
